# ImGui XNA Renderer

The code in this library is taken directly from [ImGui.NET](https://github.com/mellinoe/ImGui.NET), specifically the [XNA sample project](https://github.com/mellinoe/ImGui.NET/tree/master/src/ImGui.NET.SampleProgram.XNA)

I am using this in its original C# form because:

- I don't fully understand it, and so don't want to blindly rewrite it into F#
- It does a lot with pointers, unsafe code, reference and mutables etc which are hard to do or impossible in F#

Cheers
